                <h2>Abstract & Learning Objectives</h2>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics is a critical and rapidly evolving domain, with fairness and
                    explainability as its foundational pillars. Many papers and books have been published by
                    researchers and practitioners from different communities, addressing different aspects of fair
                    machine learning (FairML) and explainable AI (XAI). However, different papers seem to focus on
                    different definitions of fairness and explainability and propose different assessment criteria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An ML model may appear fair according to one assessment criterion but be simultaneously judged
                    unfair according to another. Furthermore, it is not entirely clear what XAI really means. This
                    tutorial provides a structured deep dive into these challenges. We will first offer a brief
                    overview of AI ethics. Then, we will introduce the diverse definitions and measurement criteria for
                    fairness in machine learning, explore multiobjective approaches to FairML, and highlight specific
                    fairness concerns in modern systems like Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI in gaming. Finally, we
                    will articulate what explainability means to different people, at different times and for different
                    purposes, how evolutionary multi-objective optimisation could be used naturally to enhance
                    explainability of machine learning models, and how XAI techniques can be used to enhance the
                    performance of evolutionary algorithms. The tutorial will conclude by synthesizing the interesting
                    synergies between FairML, XAI, and evolutionary computation, suggesting directions for future
                    research and practice.
